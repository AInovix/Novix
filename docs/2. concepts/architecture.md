# Core Architecture & Service Breakdown for AI Agent Management

Novix is designed as a highly customizable, extensible platform for building, managing, and interacting with AI agents. It provides various services through the web UI, each tailored to enhance specific functionalities required for agent management, training, interaction, and performance optimization. Below is a detailed breakdown of these core services, structured to facilitate seamless interaction with AI agents.

## 1. Agent Management
- **Purpose**: The Agent Management service enables the configuration and customization of agent parameters, ensuring that the agent can operate in line with the specific requirements of each use case. This service provides access to the following key configuration areas:
  - **Agent Settings**: Modify core settings for the agent’s behavior, including model-specific parameters (e.g., temperature, token limits, etc.) and integration with available language model providers.
  - **Service Integration**: Manage external service connections such as file systems (e.g., file reading, document processing), GitHub repositories, APIs (e.g., Whisper, DALL-E), and communication platforms (e.g., Discord). These settings empower the agent to interact with external sources, extending its capabilities beyond isolated tasks.
  - **Customization**: Configure agent preferences, including the integration of third-party APIs, and fine-tune model-specific settings to match the user’s operational context. This service helps tailor the agent’s performance to user expectations and project specifications.
- **Key Features**:
  - Modify agent behavior via configurable settings.
  - External service connectivity, including file systems, GitHub, Whisper, DALL-E, Discord, etc.
  - Adjust model-specific parameters based on provider availability.

## 2. Agent Training
- **Purpose**: The Agent Training service enables the AI agent to learn and adapt based on additional resources provided by the user. Training data can come in various formats such as text documents, web pages, GitHub repositories, and question-answer pairs. Training ensures that the agent can tailor its responses and knowledge to specific domains or tasks.
  - **Training Modes**: Support for diverse training types, including:
    - Website Scraping: Train the agent using content scraped from user-provided URLs.
    - File Formats: Enable agents to process and learn from various file types (e.g., PDFs, Word documents).
    - Q&A Pairs: Use predefined question-answer pairs to guide the agent’s learning process.
    - GitHub Repositories: Integrate and train on publicly accessible GitHub repositories for code-based knowledge.
  - **Advanced Training Options**:
    - Predefined Memory Collections: Developers can provide predefined memory structures that guide how training data is retained and retrieved.
    - Feedback Loops: Incorporate positive/negative feedback from agents or end-users to refine agent performance over time.
- **Key Features**:
  - Customizable training using web resources, files, and Q&A pairs.
  - Integration with GitHub repositories for code-specific training.
  - Feedback-driven training to continuously improve agent performance.

## 3. Agent Interactions
- **Purpose**: The Agent Interactions service governs the different modes through which the user can interact with the agent. It enables dynamic, context-sensitive exchanges based on the user’s needs and the agent’s capabilities.
  - **Interaction Modes**:
    - Chat Mode: Engage in continuous, conversational dialogues with the agent. The agent retains context over the course of the conversation, allowing for multi-turn interactions.
    - Instruct Mode: Provide specific commands or instructions for the agent to execute. This mode is useful for short, task-oriented interactions.
    - Smart Instruct Mode: A more advanced form of Instruct Mode that utilizes real-time data gathering, web searches, and adaptive planning to ensure the best possible outcome for each command.
    - Chains Mode: Execute a series of predefined, linked tasks (chains), where the output of one task feeds into the next. This mode supports task automation and complex workflows.
  - **Advanced Interaction Options**:
    - Contextual Sensitivity: Enable the agent to adjust responses based on historical interactions, the complexity of the task, and real-time input from the user.
    - Adaptive Conversations: Allow the agent to modify its responses based on ongoing interaction, utilizing dynamic memory and context awareness.
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-mode interaction capabilities, including chat, instruction, smart instructions, and task chains.
  - Context awareness for multi-turn conversations and continuous dialogue.
  - Dynamic response generation using real-time data and search.

## 4. Memory Management
- **Purpose**: Memory management controls the agent’s ability to retain, access, and utilize information gathered during interactions and training. The memory system ensures that agents can use previous knowledge to improve responses and adapt to ongoing tasks.
  - **Memory Querying**: Enable the agent to query memory for relevant information related to the current task or conversation.
  - **Training Data Integration**: Retain documents and data used in the agent’s training process, allowing the agent to recall and incorporate them during interactions.
  - **Advanced Memory Features**:
    - Predefined Memory Collections: Store and categorize specific memories for different use cases or projects, such as customer interactions, technical documents, or FAQs.
    - Relevance Scoring: Set relevance thresholds to control when memories should be recalled based on how closely they match the current task or query.
    - Memory Pruning: Implement mechanisms to prune outdated or irrelevant memories from the agent’s memory pool.
- **Key Features**:
  - Retain and manage knowledge gathered from training and interactions.
  - Set relevance thresholds for memory retrieval based on user-defined parameters.
  - Implement advanced memory querying and pruning strategies for improved memory efficiency.

## 5. Prompt Management
- **Purpose**: Prompt Management allows users to create, edit, and manage prompts that are used to interact with the agent. Prompts guide the agent’s responses and task execution, and they can be customized for specific objectives or project needs.
  - **Prompt Creation**: Define and customize prompts to guide the agent’s responses to user inputs. These prompts can be fine-tuned for specific scenarios, ensuring that the agent’s output is relevant and accurate.
  - **Prompt Editing**: Modify existing prompts as needed to adapt to changing requirements or user feedback.
  - **Prompt Deletion**: Remove unnecessary or outdated prompts from the system.
  - **Conversation Management**: Convert prompts into full conversations, allowing for dynamic interactions based on the input-output flow.
- **Key Features**:
  - Full control over prompt creation, modification, and deletion.
  - Convert prompts into interactive conversations for more fluid user experiences.
  - Customize prompts to fit specific project or use-case requirements.

## 6. Chains Management
- **Purpose**: The Chains Management service focuses on managing and optimizing task chains, which are sequences of tasks executed by the agent in a predefined order. Chains allow for complex workflows, task automation, and multi-step task processing.
  - **Chain Creation**: Define chains that consist of multiple tasks, with each task relying on the output of the previous one. Chains can be created based on user-defined logic and task dependencies.
  - **Task Sequencing**: Specify the order in which tasks are executed and define variables that can be used within the chain.
  - **Execution Control**: Fine-tune how tasks are executed in the chain, including setting maximum retries, result generation, and timeouts.
  - **Advanced Options**:
    - Retry Logic: Set the number of attempts the agent should make if a task fails.
    - Task Prioritization: Specify which tasks are of higher priority within a chain and should be executed first.
    - Variable Substitution: Use predefined or dynamically generated variables to control task behavior during chain execution.
- **Key Features**:
  - Customizable task chains with flexible execution logic.
  - Predefined and dynamic variable integration for enhanced task management.
  - Advanced control over task retries, prioritization, and execution parameters.
